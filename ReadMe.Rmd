# Laundro-Hydro

We are all undergraduates at the City University of New York - Brooklyn College. During the Spring 2019 semester, we were enrolled in CISC. 2590, Foundations of Business Analytics under Professor Pawel Walzcuk, where we learned about 
```{r}

#color = Latitude))
```

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
